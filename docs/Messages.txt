==================================================================================
I've done alot of extensive research getting the exact messages RuneScape
displays. This was very hard for two reasons...

1: Most images don't contain the chat box.
2: Some images were thumbnails/too small/poor quality.

Something that threw me off was that the message "You attempt to catch a Lobster."
has an upper case 'L', whereas the "You catch a lobster." message has
a lower case 'L'.

All punctuation and casing is exact.

Prefix:
If the beginning of the message has the [D] prefix, for example:

------------------------------------
[D]You can't carry anymore Lobsters.
------------------------------------

Then this means the message is displayed in a dialogue form.
